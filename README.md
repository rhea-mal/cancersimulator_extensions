HGSOC_gene_locations.xlsx and TNBC_gene_locations.xlsx were assembled from the following tools
 
Driver Gene List Assembly:
Gene List Source: cBio Portal
Gene Positions: NIH Gene Tool

Chromosome_CN_annoplots.Rmd and chrom_annoplots.Rmd were used in developing comparison tracks of copy number from PCAWG to 72 simulator runs.
spearman_example.Rmd were integrated into the simulator to calculate a rho correlation score between simulations and select PCAWG CN data.
